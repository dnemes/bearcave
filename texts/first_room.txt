---------------------------
You are in small room, underground. The only source of light is a torch fixed
to the wall with an iron bar. That’s the only object in the room, apart from
that it’s empty – there is only dust and some very mushy smell.

There are also two doors on the wall, one to your right,
and another to your left.

What do you do?
