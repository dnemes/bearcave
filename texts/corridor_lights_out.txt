You gather some air in your lungs, and blow away the flame of the torches.
It's very dark now, and it takes some time till your eyes adjust to the
darkness.

As your sight clears, you notice two things. There are some lines on the floor
before you, and they make up the shape of a trap door. You will need to watch
out for that in the future... The other thing is something shiny in the wall
to your right.

What do you do?
