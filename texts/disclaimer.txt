The Bear Cave –>   *ABOUT*

I'm Nemes Domonkos, a 1st year student in a postgraduate pro-
gramming school, Számalk. I wrote this game as a study project
for the 'Basics of Programming' seminar. I think of it as
of a good way to learn the fundamentals of programming, and 
to get to know to the specifics of the python language.

After I started to work on the game seriously, it soon turned 
out that I bit a lot more than I could chew, so please forgive 
me for the occasional clumsyness of the gameplay. I hope 
however, that I managed to make at least the code readable, and 
that you will have some good moments with the game.
