**   Kapanyányimonyók    **
---------------------------

You enter the room, and you see before you a seemingly evil dwarf with
very-very long, red beard, and unnaturally big testicles. He is mostly naked -
or to be exact, he wears his surprisingly long and well-cared-for beard as
clothes. He is sitting on his testicles like you would sit on a ball – 
his (its?) back is straight, his chin held high. The next thing you realise,
that the dwarf sits in front of an old television screen, which replays
recordings of people falling into the hole you just avoided, and you can hear
their screams through loudspeakers hanging from the ceiling. There is the
famous Benny Hill Show theme song going as the soundtrack.

‘Hello c*nt’ the kapanyányimonyók says, and turns to face you (his testicles
make a screeching sound as he moves).
‘You have nice reflexes compared to these idiots!’ he gestures to the
television screen. He makes that compliment while smiling at you, kind of
evilly.
‘I have a mission for you. Do you accept?’
