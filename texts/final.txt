You return to the room of the dwarf, with your loot and your honey.
"You returned!" he growls despising, and also seemingly a bit disappointed.
He paces the room (testicles bouncing all directions), and finally stops

"Give me my honey" he extends his little dirty hands in expectation.
What do you do?
