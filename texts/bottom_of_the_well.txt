As you open the door, you find yourself in a small circular space, its walls
lined with old stone bricks. As you look up you realize, that you really are
standing at the bottom of a very deep well - and in the pretty silver mist of
the summer moonlight.

You breathe in the wonderful air of the summer night. Hmm. Very tasty.

Do you go back, or do you stay a bit more?
