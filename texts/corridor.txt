**    In the corridor    **
---------------------------
You find yourself in a long corridor, which turns slightly to the left in the
distance. The smell of mush and dirt and murk strengthens as you go further
into the hallway. The lighting here is even more sparser than the one in the
room before it, there are only two torches in the middle, their light
flickering; there is some movement of air in here!
