The Bear Cave – Text Game
-------------------------

Welcome adventurer, behold the fantastic scroll of ‘help’!

The way the game works, is that it prints some text to the screen 
(usually describing your situation at that part of the game), and then 
sooner or later a prompt appears (you know, this character: ‘> ’).

Then you will need to enter commands – sometimes their wordings will be 
written up as choices, sometimes you will have to guess... The important 
thing is to not panic, and be brave to try a lot of commands in any 
situations. Swearing and bloodthirsty actions may have a very dire, or 
very funny consequences, do give them a try : ). The game basically 
understands one or two word, situation dependent commands (unless 
specified otherwise), so try to keep your ordering around short. 
Sometimes one letter abbreviations work (like ‘i’ for inventory, or ‘x’ 
for exiting the game) other times they won’t work, but don’t let that
bother you.

((To exit the game at any time, pls. hit ctrl+C or ctrl+D, depending on 
your system.))

Some words of encouragement:

This game will kill you quite often, but don’t let that drag you down, 
the point of it is the exploration of the possible outcomes. Have fun!
