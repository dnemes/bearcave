# About naming conventions:
#   ---------
#   General
#       If a name of any object is made up of several words, I will use '_' characters to separate them.
#       I will not use uppercase letters in these names.
#   ---------
#   Functions
#       I will consequently add a 'b_' prefix to all function names to avoid any accidental clashes with
#       builtin functions.
#
#   ---------
#   Variables
#       Global variables: prefix: 'g_'.
#       I plan to store certain data (like health points and inventory contents and the fulfillment of
#       certain criteria) about the game-play in global variables and make these available to other functions.
#       Local variables: i won't give locals prefixes.
