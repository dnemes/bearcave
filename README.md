# The Bear Cave
– a text-based terminal game which I write to get the hang of python.

I write this game as a study project for the 'Basics of Programming' 
seminar at Számalk. I think of it as a good way to learn the fundamentals 
of programming, and to get to know to the specifics of the python language. 
I wrote this code in the 2.7 version of python, so you will need that 
version installed to run the game from the terminal. More on that at the 
following link:

After I started to work on the game seriously, it soon turned 
out that I bit a lot more than I could chew, so please forgive 
me for the occasional clumsyness of the gameplay. I hope 
however, that I managed to make at least the code readable, and 
that you will have some good moments with the game.
